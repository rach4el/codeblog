### User Persona
Emma is a passionate equestrian who loves exploring local countryside trails with her horse. She is frustrated with the lack of easily accessible information on safe and scenic riding routes.

## Problem Statement: 
The user struggles to find up-to-date and detailed information on suitable horse riding trails in their local area and can miss out on local information. Using an unfamiliar route can mean riders are missing out on the hidden gems of scenic rides and local interest points.

## Purpose: 
Riding Reader is a news site app connects local equestrian communities allowing users to post, read and comment on shared trail routes to share their knowledge and detailed information for the safest and most sceneic riding routes. users will also be able to see the time and date of postings making sure the data presented is up-to-date,
creating a discussion community which is particularly valuable in local or remote populations.


## Target Audience:
The primary target audience include local equestrians who aim to easily discover and access a variety of safe and scenic horse riding trails in their area to enhance their experiences. As well as individuals who want to be apart of the local riding community by sharing guidance on favourite routes.

-   ### Design
-   
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are green (#AAAF88) and brown (#6E4730) relating to nature, with additional  orange (#D59041), other similar multi tones were used for highlighted elements such as link colors were (#A6B832 and #B67E3D) highlights for warmth and to have a clear striking design, and to corroberate the sites purpose theme of equestrian information routes related to nature and warm tones relating to the countryside.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto Flex font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the secondary and also a fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I chose the font Roboto flex from google fonts for my chosen favicon design for clear UX design and branding using a colour from my projects colour scheme. The reasoning behind using 'Roboto Flex' for my favicon was to have clear logo favicon for clear design branding as it is easily readable at small sizes. Using the font 'Roboto Flex' for my main font as it is a user friendly, and described by google to be highly-readable which provides clear headers as well as highly-readable body text.
        -   
    -   #### Imagery
        -   All images for the site were generated by Bing Image Creator. The large imagery on the post detail and post lists displaying on the homepage and about page were intended to be striking and catch the user's attention while also in-keeping with the sites theme. The images chosen and image styling are intended to give a warm tones with styling to be widely viewed on many devices exuding a modern, warm aesthetic connecting to nature, equestrians and the countryside.

### Agile
- This project developed using Agile principles, managed through a project board on GitHub. Creating user stories and defining acceptance criteria provided a clear roadmap and ease for udnerstanding user, site woner and admin needs. Using the project board on Github helps stay on task and meet targets for the application's features and functionalities. This approach helped me stay focused and minimized distractions.

### Known Bugs

-   On some devices the footer becomes very small and can be hard to see, a lot of media queries were created to aid in solving this bug although the testing of this available and was not done on every device manufactured.
-   On some devices the create page text surrounding the contact form becomes condensed, testing of this fixed all available device views however the testing of this available and was not done on every device manufactured.
-   On the post detail page, when updating a comment the update text box is the same box used to make a new       comment which could be confusing to the user, this could be improved in future deployments.
-   On some small devices the logo home link is pushed to the top left making the a part of the beggining letter of the logo not appear clearly on the screen, this bug was very minute and the button is viewable but could be improved.
-   On some small devices the navbar collapse and expand button can appear too far to the right of the screen causing the button to be slightly covered by the edge of the screen, testing was done and media queries were created to avoid this bug on most devices.
-   On some devices the navbar links shake when opened from the collapable button, this bug could be cause by a shortcoming in understanding and the bug is not always occuring, the navbar links are still interractive and clearly seen, however it is a slight view descrepancy that doesn't interfear with use or visability.
-   On some devices the filter on the home index of posts can disppear if no posts match the criteria of the post filter, this bug was fixed in large however it has a small chance of occuring.

## Deployment

- I followed the deployment steps used for CodeInstitutes Django blog to deploy this application. The instructions were primarily sourced from the follow-along videos and text steps provided on the Code Institute LMS.

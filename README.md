persona and user stories:

Emma is a passionate equestrian who loves exploring local countryside trails with her horse. She is frustrated with the lack of easily accessible information on safe and scenic riding routes.


Problem Statement: 
The user struggles to find up-to-date and detailed information on suitable horse riding trails in their local area and can miss out on local information. Using an unfamiliar route can mean riders are missing out on the hidden gems of scenic rides and local interest points. Additionally taking an unplanned route can have risks such as getting lost, ending up on a dangerous path, or being confronted by an unexpected hazard which is especially a concern when handling horses. 

Purpose: Riding Reader is a news site app connects local equestrian communities allowing users to post, read and comment on shared trail routes to share their knowledge and detailed information for the safest and most sceneic riding routes. users will also be able to see the time and date of postings making sure the data presented is up-to-date,
creating a discussion community which is particularly valuable in local or remote populations.


Target Audience: The primary target audience include local equestrians who aim to easily discover and access a variety of safe and scenic horse riding trails in their area to enhance their experiences. As well as individuals who want to be apart of the local riding community by sharing guidance on favourite routes.

-Font Awesome and flaticon were used for icons and the fonts used were derived from Google Fonts. 

The font Roboto flex from google fonts as my chosen favicon design for clear UX design and branding using a colour from my projects colour scheme. The reasoning behind this was to have clear logo favicon for clear design and Roboto is a user friendly, and described by google to be highly-readable which provides clear headers as well as highly-readable body text.

-Wireframes, and flowcharts were created using Canva.

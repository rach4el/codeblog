Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!



persona and user stories:

Emma is a passionate equestrian who loves exploring local countryside trails with her horse. She is frustrated with the lack of easily accessible information on safe and scenic riding routes.


Problem Statement: 
The user struggles to find up-to-date and detailed information on suitable horse riding trails in their local area and can miss out on local information. Using an unfamiliar route can mean riders are missing out on the hidden gems of scenic rides and local interest points. Additionally taking an unplanned route can have risks such as getting lost, ending up on a dangerous path, or being confronted by an unexpected hazard which is especially a concern when handling horses. 

Purpose: Riding Reader is a news site app connects local equestrian communities allowing users to post, read and comment on shared trail routes to share their knowledge and detailed information for the safest and most sceneic riding routes. users will also be able to see the time and date of postings making sure the data presented is up-to-date,
creating a discussion community which is particularly valuable in local or remote populations.


Target Audience: The primary target audience include local equestrians who aim to easily discover and access a variety of safe and scenic horse riding trails in their area to enhance their experiences. As well as individuals who want to be apart of the local riding community by sharing guidance on favourite routes.

Favicon:

-I used a favicon generator for favicon design (https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/).

The font DM Serif Display from google fonts as my chosen favicon design for clear UX design and branding using a colour from my projects colour scheme. The reasoning behind this was to have clear logo favicon for clear design and DM Sans is described by google as a sans serif design, intended for use at smaller text sizes. DM Sans offers a clean, modern appearance that works well in minimalist design. This sans serif typeface features a geometric form with rounded corners that give it a friendly yet professional look.
